# WWC-Feature
Google Places API JavaScript feature integrated into Ruby on Rails


Women Who Code (WWC), a Global Non-Profit Organization was looking for assistance fixing a bug in their current "Create a New Network" application.		 

Problem:  	Geocoder Gem was inaccurate and allowed users (WWC employees) to type 
            words other than locations.  Did not document lat and lng at times.

Task:       Implement Google Maps feature seamlessly on top of Ruby without disrupting the      	
            current framework as this was an active page.

Challenges: Prior to this project, I had not worked with Ruby before so there was a bit of a learning curve just to get started.  It was 
			challenging to work with a large, active codebase. It was crucial to be very careful about workflow in order to avoid conflicts (e.g., rebasing daily, restructiong schemadb weekly, etc).

Outcome: 	Success! Google Places API JavaScript feature integrated into Ruby on Rails
