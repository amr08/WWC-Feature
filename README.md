# Google Places API JavaScript feature integrated into Ruby on Rails


## Women Who Code (WWC), a Global Non-Profit Organization, was looking for assistance fixing a bug in their current "Create a New Network" internal application.		 

**Problem:**  	Geocoder Gem was inaccurate and allowed users (WWC employees) to submit 
            words other than locations and therefore did not capture latitude and longitude coordinates.

**Task:**       Implement Google Maps feature seamlessly on top of Ruby without disrupting the      	
            current framework as this was an active page.

**Challenges:** Prior to this project, I had not worked with Ruby so there was a bit of a learning curve to navigate the Dev 			 Environment.  Because this was a large, active codebase, it was crucial to be careful about workflow in order to avoid conflicts (e.g., rebasing daily, updating schemaDB often, etc).

**Outcome:** 	Success! Google Places API JavaScript feature with Google Maps, autocomplete, and autopopulate integrated into Ruby on Rails.
